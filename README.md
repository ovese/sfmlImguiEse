Finally got the sfml wrapper to work
Code blocks required configuration which i will describe in this readme file to work

I had to be sure which version of the sfml library i was downloading for my version of codeblock

Next, setting the compiler and linker directories is most important

The above setting must be done with the dbug and release configuration in mind

lastly, I dont know if this was all too important but I added the dll files in bin directory to the
programs executable path/folder
